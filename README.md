# odin-recipes
Hello! This is my first project while learning Web Development with TheOdinProject.
Best of luck to me and I'll do my very best in finishing all of the projects beautifully!

SO here are my step-by-step guides for this project...

To start we need to have a repository in the github for future uses.
Clone that repos into your local machine and start there.
Create a directory that will store all your files.
Create a basic html boilerplate and within the body create an H1 and put "Recipes"
Below that create a link that will redirect to one of the recipes.
Create another directory inside the main directory called recipes and within that create the recipe file.
Repeat all the steps.
