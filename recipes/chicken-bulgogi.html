        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Chicken Bulgogi is an easy and quick Korean BBQ chicken recipe 
            made with gochujang. You can grill this slightly sweet and savory 
            chicken, broil it in the oven, or pan-fry it. Perfect for a weeknight dinner!</p>
        <p>Chicken Bulgogi can be made with soy sauce based seasoning, which has its own 
            unique savory flavor.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>Boneless skinless chicken thigh</ul>
            <ul>Chicken bulgogi (Korean BBQ chicken) sauce</ul>
        <p><strong> Korean Barbecue Sauce Ingredients: </strong><p>
            <ul>gochujang</ul>
            <ul>gochugaru</ul>
            <ul>soy sauce</ul>
            <ul>light brown sugar</ul>
            <ul>Korean corn syrup</ul>
            <ul>garlic</ul>
            <ul>ginger puree</ul>
            <ul>sesame oil</ul>
            
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>Pound chicken thigh with a meat hammer. 
                This will tenderize chicken and help cook the chicken faster and more even.</ol>
            <ol>Mix all the seasoning ingredients in a large mixing bowl to make the paste.</ol>
            <ol>Add chicken and toss well to coat the chicken with the seasoning. I recommend 
                to let it sit in a room temperature for 10 minutes while you are preheating 
                the oven to broil.</ol>
            <ol><p>Grease a cooling rack and place it on a large baking sheet 
                (lined with piece of foil for easy clean up). Put chicken pieces and broil for 
                4-5 minute per each side until the surface is slightly charred and chicken is fully cooked.</p>
                <p>The oven shelving should be about 5-6 inch below the heat source. Watch carefully so that 
                you don't char the chicken too much.</p></ol>
            <ol>Cut up the chicken into a bite size chunks for easy serving. Transfer on a serving dish and garnish 
                with perilla leaves or chopped green onion.</ol>
