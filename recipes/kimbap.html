        <p> Kimbap (or gimbap) is Korean seaweed roll made with rice, vegetables and seaweed. 
            Kimbap is an all-time favorite Korean picnic food. Some people calls Korean kimbap

            <ol>Drizzle 2 tbsp of Korean plum extract and a couple pinches salt over freshly cooked rice 
                and toss well. Cover rice with a kitchen towel and let it cool.</ol>
            <ol><p>It's convenient to use a store-bought radish pickles and burdock roots combo that can be 
                easily purchased at Korean stores. Make sure to drain them well before using. Remove the plastic 
                wrap from the imitation crab meat and set aside..</p>

                <p>For the egg: Beat eggs and cook in a skillet over medium heat in 3 batches. Roll them up 
                    and slice thinly
                For the carrot: cook shredded carrot in a skillet in a little bit of oil with some salt. 
                Add 2 tbsp of water to create a steam and cover with a lid. Cook for 2 minutes until crisp 
                but tender.</p>
                <p>For the fishcake: slice fishcake sheets thinly and stir-fry in a little oil for 1 minute 
                    over medium high heat. Mix together soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine in a small mixing 
                    bowl, and then add the mixture to the fishcake. Continue to stir-fry for another minute.
                For the spinach: blanch spinach in a pot of boiling water with some salt. Drain and rinse 
                with cold water. Squeeze out the excess water. Place spinach in a mixing bowl and season 
                with salt, sesame oil, and sesame seeds. Toss well.</p></ol>
